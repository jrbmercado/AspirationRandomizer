# AspirationRandomizer
## A simple program created using TKinter
This program's functionality is to randomly select from a list of aspirations within Sims 4.

Features:
  - Generate Button: Selects a random aspiration from all game packs
  
Future Plans:
  - Improve display to also show which game expansion the aspiration comes from and what category it resides in
  - Add buttons to filter which aspirations can be selected from, the buttons would be the various game expansions the user does/does not have
